Thanks for checking out Dirty Beaches, the app that is committed to making sure that the beaches you love stay clean!

Dirty Beaches is for anyone who cares about beach cleanliness, from the casual beach goer who just wants to have a fun day on the beach that isnâ€™t tainted by trash, to the passionate activist who wants to organize groups to go out and actually clean up the mess. 

If you are on a beach that needs some attention, just mark it as dirty and it will let others know. If you want to get your hands dirty, find a beach near you that needs the most love and go make a difference!
